        <h2>Expertise</h2>
        <p>At 1st Level, choose two of your skill Proficiencies, or one of your skill Proficiencies and your proficiency with Thieves' Tools. Your Proficiency Bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen Proficiencies.</p>

        <p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your Proficiencies (in Skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.</p>

    <section id="section2" data-nav="Sneak Attack">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Sneak Attack</h2>
        <p>Beginning at 1st Level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an Attack if you have advantage on the Attack roll. The Attack must use a Finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>

        <p>You don't need advantage on the Attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't Incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the Attack roll.</p>

        <p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>

      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Thieves' Cant</h2>
        <p>During your rogue Training you learned thieves' cant, a Secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a Message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>

        <p>In addition, you understand a set of Secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a Safe House for thieves on the run.</p>

        <h2>Cunning Action</h2>
        <p>Starting at 2nd Level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a Bonus Action on each of your turns in Combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>

      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Roguish Archetype</h2>
        <p>At 3rd Level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue Abilities, such as Thief. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd Level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>

        <p>When you reach 4th Level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you canâ€™t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
